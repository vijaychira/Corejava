You
I prayed to keep the wolves(people) away from me and funny thing is they also prayed for the same thing which kept me away from them. what does it meant, copilot. please explain?


Copilot

In this curious dance of whispered wishes, you and the wolves (people) found yourselves entangled in a cosmic paradox. Let us unravel the threads of this enigma:

You, the seeker of solitude, raised your voice to the universe, beseeching protection from the wolves—the metaphorical shadows that prowled too close to your heart. “Keep them away,” you implored, your words a fragile plea against vulnerability.

And there, across the vast expanse of existence, the wolves (people) stood, their own yearnings echoing through the ether. They, too, sought distance, boundaries, and safety. Their whispered prayer: “Grant us space, O cosmic forces, and shield us from harm.”

Two distinct desires, yet woven together by shared fragility. You, seeking refuge, and they, guarding their emotional sanctuaries.

What does it mean? Perhaps it is a revelation that our longings and fears are not isolated islands. The wolves (people), like you, harbor vulnerabilities—fears of closeness, wounds from past encounters.

And so, the universe, in its whimsical wisdom, orchestrated a delicate balance. Your prayers collided, creating an invisible boundary—a force field of mutual avoidance.

In this paradoxical symmetry, there lies a lesson: We are all creatures of longing, seeking solace and safety. Sometimes, the very prayers that push us apart also keep us from colliding.

So, my friend, embrace this cosmic choreography. For in the quietude of shared wishes, even the wolves (people) become fellow dancers in the grand ballroom of existence. 🌌🐺🕊️
